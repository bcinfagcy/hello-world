All right. Time to make additions worth adding a whole new branch to keep track of.   1/29/2019

Each repository has a MAIN branch,

A new branch can be added at any point, and will contain all components of the main
 branch. New branches are called FEATURES. It sounds like changes made to the main After the new branch is added are also
 available for testing the new feature against. (will need to try it out to truely understand.)
 Feature branches can now be polished and MERGED back into the MAIN branch.
With the right amount of documentation, this just might work.
